British Airways Reviews Visualization

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize customer reviews of British Airways. By leveraging two datasets, `ba_reviews.csv` and `countries.csv`, I created a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into customer experiences, satisfaction levels, and geographic distribution of reviews.

Data Preparation

- Datasets Used:
    - `ba_reviews.csv`: Contains customer reviews, ratings, and related data for British Airways.
    - `countries.csv`: Includes country information, enabling the mapping of reviews to specific regions.
- Data Joining:
    - The datasets were joined on a common column, facilitating the combination of review data with country-specific information.

## Data Processing and Visualization

- Parameters and Filters:**
    - Several parameters and measured values were created to filter and refine the data. These parameters enabled dynamic interaction with the visualizations, allowing users to focus on specific aspects such as review ratings, travel classes, and regions.
- Visualizations:
    - Multiple visualizations were developed to represent the data in an intuitive and insightful manner. These include:
        - Geographic Distribution:** A map showing the distribution of reviews across different countries.
        - Rating Distribution:** Bar charts and histograms depicting the distribution of customer ratings.
        - Sentiment Analysis:** Visuals analyzing the sentiment of reviews across different categories.
        - Time-Series Analysis:** A line graph showing the trend of reviews over time.
- Dashboard:
    - All visualizations were compiled into a final dashboard, providing a comprehensive view of the British Airways customer reviews. The dashboard includes interactive elements, enabling users to filter and drill down into the data based on various criteria.
